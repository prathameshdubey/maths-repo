In this type of question we consider the forward movement to bw equal to the backward movement and we consider the delta of usual speed vs the case presented 




This type of question we consider the forward movement from the person and the backward movement from the other person to be equal to the length of the track they are moving in

To solve this question consider the object with no thickness (in this case lamppost to be a criteria for covering its own length ) and the platform in this case to be a representative of length of train - platform
